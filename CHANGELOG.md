## [0.1.4] - 2025-05-26

### Added

- **Advanced Manifest Validation System:**
  - **Schema Validation:** Comprehensive validation of all manifest fields with intelligent typo detection and suggestions.
  - **Template Expression Validation:** Full validation of `${{ ... }}` expressions including syntax checking and dependency validation.
  - **Dependency Order Validation:** Ensures stack outputs only reference stacks defined earlier in the pipeline.
  - **Line Number Tracking:** Precise error reporting with line numbers when available for schema errors.
  - **Multiple Error Collection:** All validation errors are collected and presented together instead of failing on first error.
  - **Smart Suggestions:** Levenshtein distance-based suggestions for common field name typos (e.g., `parameterss` â†’ `params`).

- **Enhanced Error Formatting:**
  - Clean unnumbered bullet list format for multiple errors.
  - Line numbers shown in parentheses at the end of error messages when available.
  - Context-aware error messages with specific field locations.
  - Helpful suggestions for common syntax errors (e.g., `stack.` vs `stacks.` in expressions).

- **Validation Features:**
  - Validates all known fields: pipeline root, pipeline_settings, and stack definitions.
  - Catches forward references in stack output expressions.
  - Validates environment variable and stack output expression syntax.
  - Provides available stack lists when referencing nonexistent stacks.
  - Comprehensive test coverage with 19 validation-specific tests.

### Changed

- **Improved `samstacks validate` Command:**
  - Now provides comprehensive validation instead of basic syntax checking.
  - Enhanced error messages with actionable suggestions.
  - Better user experience with clear, scannable error formatting.

### Fixed

- **Type System Improvements:**
  - Added missing return type annotations to resolve mypy errors.
  - Fixed module path conflicts in mypy configuration with `explicit_package_bases = true`.
  - Enhanced type safety across validation module.

### Documentation

- **Comprehensive Validation Documentation:**
  - Added new "Advanced Validation Features" section to README.
  - Documented schema validation, template expression validation, and error formatting.
  - Added validation best practices and troubleshooting guidance.
  - Enhanced CLI Commands section with detailed validation examples.
  - Updated Table of Contents and Troubleshooting sections.

## [0.1.3] - 2025-05-26

### Added

- **Enhanced SAM Deployment Parameters:**
  - Automatically sets `--s3-prefix` to match the stack name for consistent S3 artifact organization.
  - Automatically enables `--resolve-s3` to let SAM create and manage S3 buckets for deployment artifacts.
  - These parameters are now automatically applied alongside the existing `--stack-name` override.

### Changed

- **Improved Versioning System:**
  - Migrated from manual version management to Hatch's automatic version generation.
  - Version is now managed in a single source of truth: `pyproject.toml`.
  - Auto-generates `samstacks/version.py` during build process.
  - CI/CD workflow now reads version from generated file instead of `__init__.py`.
  - Added fallback version mechanism for development when `version.py` doesn't exist.

### Documentation

- **Enhanced README:**
  - Added new "SAM Deployment Parameters" section explaining automatic parameter handling.
  - Documented how `samstacks` overrides `samconfig.toml` settings for consistency.
  - Clarified which `samconfig.toml` settings are respected vs. overridden.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-05-26

### Documentation

- Minor documentation updates and improvements.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-05-26

### Documentation

- Documentation fixes and clarifications.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-05-25

### Added

- **Core Pipeline Engine:**
  - Deploy a pipeline of AWS SAM stacks defined in a YAML manifest.
  - Sequential stack deployment respecting manifest order.
  - Global pipeline settings: `stack_name_prefix`, `stack_name_suffix`, `default_region`, `default_profile`.
  - Per-stack settings: `id`, `name`, `description`, `dir` (relative to manifest), `params`, `stack_name_suffix`, `region`, `profile`.
- **Advanced Templating System:**
  - Support for `${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME }}` for environment variable substitution.
  - Support for `${{ stacks.<stack_id>.outputs.<OutputName> }}` for cross-stack output referencing.
  - Support for `||` operator for default values in expressions (e.g., `${{ env.VAR || 'default' }}`).
- **`samconfig.toml` Integration:**
  - Preprocessing of `samconfig.toml` for `${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME }}` substitutions.
  - Uses processed `samconfig.toml` for `sam build` and `sam deploy`.
- **Conditional Stack Deployment:**
  - `if` field in stack definitions to control deployment based on templated conditions.
- **Post-Deployment Scripts:**
  - `run` field in stack definitions for executing shell scripts after successful deployment.
  - Scripts support template substitution and run in the stack's directory.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**
  - `samstacks deploy <manifest_file>` command with options for region, profile, debug, quiet.
  - `samstacks validate <manifest_file>` command.
  - `samstacks --version`.
  - Real-time streaming of `sam deploy` output.
  - **`--auto-delete-failed` flag:** 
    - Proactively deletes stacks in `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` state before deployment.
    - Proactively deletes pre-existing 'FAILED' changesets with "No updates are to be performed." reason.
- **Automatic Cleanup:**
  - Default behavior: Automatically deletes the 'FAILED' changeset created by SAM CLI when a stack deployment results in "No changes to deploy."
- **Enhanced CLI Presentation:**
  - Integration with `rich` library for styled output (headers, tables, status messages).
  - Quieter logging for `boto3`/`botocore` by default.
  - UI styling inspired by `otel_layer_utils/ui_utils.py` (no emojis, no panels, specific prefixes).
- **Error Handling & Robustness:**
  - Graceful handling of "No changes to deploy" from SAM CLI.
  - Custom exception hierarchy (`SamStacksError`).
- **Development Setup:**
  - Instructions for `uv` and `ruff` in `README.md`.
  - Target Python 3.12+.
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow:**
  - Workflow for testing on PRs/pushes (Python 3.12, x64).
  - Quality checks (ruff, mypy, pytest with coverage).
  - Conditional publishing to PyPI on pushes to `main` branch, including version checking and Git tagging.
  - Codecov integration.

### Changed

- Stack directory paths (`dir`) in the manifest are now resolved relative to the manifest file's location, not the Current Working Directory.

### Fixed

- Addressed various bugs and improved stability during iterative development of features.
- Resolved circular import issue between `core.py` and `cli.py` by introducing `presentation.py`.
- Corrected path handling for post-deployment scripts.
