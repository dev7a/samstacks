## [0.3.1] - 2025-05-26

### Added

- **Templated Default Values for Pipeline Inputs:**
  - Input `default` values can now use template expressions with environment variables.
  - Supports `${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME || 'fallback_literal' }}` syntax in input defaults.
  - Enables dynamic default values based on environment configuration.
  - Template expressions in defaults are evaluated once when the pipeline starts.
  - Provides a powerful way to define "variables" in the pipeline that can be reused across multiple stacks.

### Changed

- **Enhanced Input Processing:**
  - Input default values are now resolved and validated before the main template processor is initialized.
  - Template expressions in input defaults are restricted to environment variables only (no stack outputs or other inputs).
  - Improved error handling for malformed template expressions in input defaults.
  - Added validation to ensure templated defaults resolve to values compatible with their declared input type.

### Fixed

- **Template Processing Improvements:**
  - Fixed handling of unquoted literals in template expressions (e.g., numeric and boolean fallbacks).
  - Improved `TemplateProcessor._resolve_single_part` to correctly handle unrecognized expressions as literal strings.
  - Enhanced error specificity by catching `ManifestError` instead of generic `Exception` in template processing.

### Documentation

- **Updated README:**
  - Added comprehensive documentation for templated default values in pipeline inputs.
  - Enhanced examples showing environment variable usage in input defaults.
  - Clarified the evaluation order and restrictions for templated defaults.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-05-26

### Added

- **Pipeline Inputs Feature:**
  - Define typed runtime inputs for pipelines via `pipeline_settings.inputs` in the manifest.
    - Supported input types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`.
    - Each input can have a `description` and a `default` value.
    - Inputs without a default are considered required.
  - Provide input values via CLI using `--input <name=value>` or `-i <name=value>` (multiple allowed).
  - Use inputs in template expressions with `${{ inputs.input_name }}` syntax.
  - Inputs participate in the `||` fallback logic, with CLI values taking precedence over defaults.
  - **Validation:**
    - Manifest validation checks the structure and types of input definitions (e.g., `type` value, compatibility of `default` with `type`).
    - Runtime validation ensures required inputs are provided and CLI-supplied values match their defined types (`number`, `boolean`).
  - **Templating:**
    - `TemplateProcessor` now resolves `${{ inputs.<name> }}`, correctly handling CLI overrides, defaults, and type conversions for use in templates.
  - **Examples:**
    - Added `examples/inputs-pipeline.yml` demonstrating various uses of pipeline inputs, including conditional stack deployment and parameterization.
  - **Testing:**
    - Comprehensive unit tests for input validation in `ManifestValidator`.
    - Unit tests for runtime input checks in `Pipeline.validate()`.
    - Unit tests for `TemplateProcessor`'s handling of input resolution and fallbacks.

### Changed

- **CLI (`deploy` command):**
  - Added `--input`/`-i` option to accept pipeline input values.
- **Core:**
  - `Pipeline` class now manages defined inputs (from manifest) and CLI-provided inputs.
  - `TemplateProcessor` updated to support `${{ inputs.<name> }}` resolution.
- **Validation:**
  - `ManifestValidator` extended to validate the `pipeline_settings.inputs` schema.
  - `Pipeline.validate()` now checks for missing required inputs and type mismatches in CLI-provided inputs.
- **Input Handling Improvements:**
  - CLI input values are now automatically trimmed of leading/trailing whitespace.
  - Whitespace-only CLI input values are treated as not provided, allowing fallback to defaults.
  - Boolean input validation now consistently accepts `on`/`off` values in addition to `true`/`false`, `yes`/`no`, `1`/`0`.
  - Error messages for undefined inputs now display available inputs as comma-separated strings for better readability.
  - Unknown CLI input keys (not defined in `pipeline_settings.inputs`) are now rejected with clear error messages to prevent silent misconfiguration.
  - Refactored CLI input processing logic into a shared utility function (`input_utils.process_cli_input_value`) to reduce code duplication between validation and templating.
  - Enhanced CLI input parsing documentation to clarify that values containing '=' will only split on the first occurrence.
  - Improved validation error messages for input default values with more granular type checking and clearer error descriptions.

### Added

- **Advanced Manifest Validation System:**
  - **Schema Validation:** Comprehensive validation of all manifest fields with intelligent typo detection and suggestions.
  - **Template Expression Validation:** Full validation of `${{ ... }}` expressions including syntax checking and dependency validation.
  - **Dependency Order Validation:** Ensures stack outputs only reference stacks defined earlier in the pipeline.
  - **Line Number Tracking:** Precise error reporting with line numbers when available for schema errors.

- **Validation Features:**
  - Validates all known fields: pipeline root, pipeline_settings, and stack definitions.
  - Catches forward references in stack output expressions.
  - Validates environment variable and stack output expression syntax.
  - Provides available stack lists when referencing nonexistent stacks.
  - Comprehensive test coverage with 19 validation-specific tests.

### Changed

- **Improved `samstacks validate` Command:**

## [0.1.0] - 2025-05-25

### Added

- **Core Pipeline Engine:**
  - Deploy a pipeline of AWS SAM stacks defined in a YAML manifest.
  - Sequential stack deployment respecting manifest order.
  - Global pipeline settings: `stack_name_prefix`, `stack_name_suffix`, `default_region`, `default_profile`.

  - Support for `${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME }}` for environment variable substitution.
  - Support for `${{ stacks.<stack_id>.outputs.<OutputName> }}` for cross-stack output referencing.
  - Support for `||` operator for default values in expressions (e.g., `${{ env.VAR || 'default' }}`).
- **`samconfig.toml` Integration:**
  - Preprocessing of `samconfig.toml` for `${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME }}` substitutions.
  - Uses processed `samconfig.toml` for `sam build` and `sam deploy`.
- **Conditional Stack Deployment:**
  - `if` field in stack definitions to control deployment based on templated conditions.
- **Post-Deployment Scripts:**
  - `run` field in stack definitions for executing shell scripts after successful deployment.
  - Scripts support template substitution and run in the stack's directory.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**
  - `samstacks deploy <manifest_file>` command with options for region, profile, debug, quiet.
  - `samstacks validate <manifest_file>` command.
  - `samstacks --version`.
  - Real-time streaming of `sam deploy` output.
  - **`--auto-delete-failed` flag:** 
    - Proactively deletes stacks in `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` state before deployment.
    - Proactively deletes pre-existing 'FAILED' changesets with "No updates are to be performed." reason.
- **Automatic Cleanup:**
  - Default behavior: Automatically deletes the 'FAILED' changeset created by SAM CLI when a stack deployment results in "No changes to deploy."
- **Enhanced CLI Presentation:**
  - Integration with `rich` library for styled output (headers, tables, status messages).
  - Quieter logging for `boto3`/`botocore` by default.
  - UI styling inspired by `otel_layer_utils/ui_utils.py` (no emojis, no panels, specific prefixes).
- **Error Handling & Robustness:**
  - Graceful handling of "No changes to deploy" from SAM CLI.
  - Custom exception hierarchy (`SamStacksError`).
- **Development Setup:**
  - Instructions for `uv` and `ruff` in `README.md`.
  - Target Python 3.12+.

  - Workflow for testing on PRs/pushes (Python 3.12, x64).
  - Quality checks (ruff, mypy, pytest with coverage).
  - Conditional publishing to PyPI on pushes to `main` branch, including version checking and Git tagging.
  - Codecov integration.

### Changed
